The goal of this project is to implement a convolutional neural network for classifying images in the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 color images with pixel dimensions 32 × 32. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The main task is to implement a convolutional neural network that is loosely inspired by the AlexNet architecture.

Libraries and frameworks:
• Python
• Matplotlib, Numpy and Pandas
• Sklearn and Kera
